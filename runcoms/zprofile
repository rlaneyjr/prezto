# ### zprofile
# 
# This file is similar to zlogin, but it is sourced before zshrc. It was added
# for [KornShell][1] fans. See the description of zlogin below for what it may
# contain.
# 
# zprofile and zlogin are not meant to be used concurrently but can be done so.

# ### zlogin
# 
# This file is sourced by login shells after zshrc, and thus, it should contain
# commands that need to execute at login. It is usually used for messages such as
# [fortune][2], [msgs][3], or for the creation of files.
# 
# This is not the file to define aliases, functions, shell options, and key
# bindings. It should not change the shell environment.

##### COREUTILS ADDED to "PATH" and "MANPATH" #####
# All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.
# If you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you
# can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:
#     PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
# Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
# the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:
#     MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
